# 🚀 Deploy New OYE System to Netlify

## ✅ Radical Redesign - No Backward Compatibility

The OYE (Observe-Yor-Estimates) system has been completely redesigned with a clean, modern architecture. All legacy endpoints have been removed in favor of a single, intelligent `/oye` command that provides context-aware responses exactly where users request them.

## 📋 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Environment Variables in Netlify

**Required Variables:**
```bash
# Core functionality
TIMECAMP_API_TOKEN=your_timecamp_token
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Slack integration
SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your_verification_token
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token

# Optional: For separate server deployment
SERVER_URL=https://your-app-name.netlify.app
```

**⚠️ SLACK_BOT_TOKEN is now required** - the system no longer falls back to webhooks.

### 2. Slack App Configuration

**Replace ALL old commands with:**
- Command: `/oye`
- Request URL: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app/slack/oye`
- Description: "OYE task updates and syncing"

**Required Bot Token Scopes:**
- `chat:write` - Send messages to channels
- `chat:write.public` - Send messages to channels user isn't in

**⚠️ Delete old commands** (`/daily-update`, `/weekly-update`, `/monthly-update`, `/full-sync`) - they no longer work.

### 3. Deploy to Netlify

Your existing `netlify.toml` has been updated to support the new system:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement unified OYE system with context-aware responses"
git push origin master
```

### 4. Test Deployment

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.netlify.app/health
# Should return: "OK - Database connected"
```

**New Unified Command:**
```
/oye                    # Daily update with user's preferences
/oye weekly             # Weekly summary
/oye monthly            # Monthly report
/oye sync               # Full data synchronization
/oye config             # View/change preferences
```

## 🎯 New User Experience

### Before vs After

**Old System:**
```
User: /daily-update (in #random)
Bot: [posts in #oye-channel] ❌ Wrong place!
```

**New System:**
```
User: /oye daily (in #random)
Bot: ⏳ Processing your request... (immediate response in #random)
Bot: 📊 Querying database... (progress update in thread)
Bot: 📈 Analyzing time entries... (progress update in thread)
Bot: ✅ [Complete update results] (final response in #random)
```

## 🔧 Migration Required

**⚠️ Breaking Changes - Immediate Action Required:**

1. **Delete old Slack commands** - they will return errors
2. **Add `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`** - required for the new system
3. **Update team** - everyone must use `/oye` instead of old commands

**Migration Steps:**
1. Deploy new code to Netlify
2. Add required environment variables
3. Create `/oye` slash command in Slack
4. Delete old slash commands
5. Notify team of new command syntax

## 🎨 New Features

### User Preferences
Users can customize their experience:
```
/oye config             # View current settings
/oye config public      # Make updates visible to channel
/oye config private     # Keep updates private (default)
/oye config daily       # Set daily as default period
```

### Intelligent Command Parsing
Single command handles everything:
```
/oye                    # User's default period + visibility
/oye weekly public      # One-time public weekly update
/oye sync               # Full data synchronization
/oye help               # Show all available options
```

### Real-time Progress
Users see exactly what's happening:
```
⏳ Processing your request...
📊 Querying database...
📈 Analyzing time entries...
✍️ Formatting report...
✅ [Final results]
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Netlify Function Logs
**Success Patterns:**
```
Unified OYE function called
Using new unified Go server system
Successfully processed unified command via Go server
```

**Legacy Fallback Patterns:**
```
Falling back to legacy webhook system
Legacy update processing: daily
Successfully completed daily update
```

**Error Patterns to Watch:**
```
Go server returned error: [status]
Bot token available: false
Processing failed: [error]
```

### Environment Variable Check
```bash
# Test bot token availability
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
  https://slack.com/api/auth.test
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Users Not Seeing New Features
1. Verify `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set in Netlify
2. Check bot permissions in Slack app settings
3. Ensure `/oye` command points to correct endpoint

### Responses Still Going to Wrong Channel
1. Bot token may not be configured - check environment variables
2. User may be using old commands - guide them to `/oye`
3. Legacy fallback is working - this is expected without bot token

### Commands Timing Out
1. Check Netlify function logs for errors
2. Verify Go binary is building correctly
3. Test database connectivity via `/health` endpoint

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Responses appear where they asked
- ✅ Real-time progress feedback
- ✅ Customizable privacy settings
- ✅ Single, intuitive command interface

### For Administrators:
- ✅ Centralized command handling
- ✅ Better error tracking and debugging
- ✅ Graceful fallback to legacy system
- ✅ No breaking changes during migration

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

With the new architecture in place, future improvements become easier:
- Interactive buttons for sharing/configuring
- Custom time range queries
- Team summary reports
- Scheduled personal notifications
- Integration with other tools
